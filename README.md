# PetroPulse DSEAT Classification

This project implements a machine learning classification model for **PetroPulse DSEAT** dataset analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
The notebook `PetroPulse_DSEAT_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb` contains data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Machine learning classification (scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch TabNet, etc.)
- Model evaluation metrics and visualization
- Reproducible workflow in Jupyter Notebook

## Requirements
Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/PetroPulse_DSEAT_CLASSIFICATION.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the folder:
